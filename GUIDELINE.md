# Contributing to Lattice FPGA Project
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Name the branch according to what you are adding; feat/ for feature, test/ for tests, docs/ for documentation with a name that describes the addition.
     - Example: feat/NewImages
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL-3.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood to be under the same [GPL-3.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Riley-Cox/ECE412-LatticeFPGA/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); we are also using issues to track work in progress

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's [an example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)


## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Tabs for indentation
* You can try running `verilator --lint-only` for style unification
* Single camel case to be used for variables
    - Example: myVar
* Double camel case to be used for module names
    - Example: MyModule
