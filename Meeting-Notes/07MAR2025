Meeting Notes 07MAR2025

Struggling overall with internal clock signal generation for Radiant

Mohammad:
  Debugging SPI module; will try post-synth sim this weekend and see if there are any obvious issues there
  Figured out how to get programming to work on local machine; big turn around time save

Riley:
  Waiting for integration
  Looking into Yosys integration for SPI

HaoYang:
  3D model complete; waiting for print until a board is available (Rahul was supposed to drop boards off today, Nathan never followed up)

Xiang:
  Figured out how to print text in principle; each character is going to consume 5 bytes in memory, full font table is 2.2k each, minimum font table is ~500 bytes

Nathan:
  Got buttons/PWM/color change proof of concept; will need to wait until full integration to complete to ensure correct values/pinouts

Next week:
  TODO:
    Write initialization process in C
    Write color change functions in C
    Start integration for SPI module once it's ready (get it ready!)
    Finish testing SPI module
    Need to add securing mechanisms to 3D enclosure and print it for fit testing
