Meeting Notes 24MAR2025

Last week was finals week, this week spring break. Come up with plan for documentation and integration. Use this week to get ahead.

Mohammad:
  Integration for SPI - start getting the SPI module into the RISC-V package, take notes on potentially adding in a UART-activated SPI as well

Xiang:
  Documentation - Nathan to loop in on conversations with Rahul, Roy, and Andrew on the user guide requirements

HaoYang:
  Make test circuits - need to physically wire debounced buttons so we can test PWM/button SV modules

Riley:
  Assist with integration as needed.
  Add conditional compilation so we have one source for both Radiant and Yosys
  Send notes to Mohammad to test Yosys-synth SPI module for unit test

Nathan:
  Integrate PWM and button modules. Starting today, use process as integration template for other modules. 

Riley was late. Nathan to have offline discussion to address.
