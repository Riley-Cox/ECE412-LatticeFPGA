Meeting Notes 09MAY2025

Mohammad: (slowly losing his mind)
  Radiant issues persist;
    Used SSR from Nathan/Riley implementation
    Timing issues solved; issue between PLL and HSOSC solved (create clock directive in constraint files)
    Program not running correctly. Will troubleshoot using the protoboard to see if the issue is Icicle specific or the entire bit stream.
  Cookies for Mohammad; started on Radiant user guide while working !!!!!!!

Xiang:
  Still working on documentation. Will provide itemized list of needs from other team members.
  Will provide templates for team members to fill out dev guide as needed
  Draft due end of May

Haoyang:
  PCB work continued; redesigned footprint for UPDuino to match V2.1 instead of V3.x
  Will provide Nathan w/ daily updates on PCB until it's complete with requests for assistance as needed

Nathan:
  Battery no longer needs USB connector for Icicle to work correctly; implemented a single cycle reset on startup to force PC to be at a known value on start
  Helped verify user guide

Riley:
  Helped with single cycle reset implementation
  "Finalized" user guide - needs independent verification (will probably ask Violet)

All team members not actively with tasks will help Haoyang as needed with PCB design; largest remaining technical item.
