Meeting notes 28FEB2025

Xiang:
  Has documentation for filling the whole screen. Will confirm things are working once we have successful bit stream programming

Mohammad/Nathan:
  Attempting to debug Radiant toolchain; bit stream programming not successful yet (leads based on Rahul information)

HaoYang:
  Modeling heart-shaped 3D print per Rahul's request, issues with curved lines.

Riley:
  Trying to deal with Radiant issue as well

Next week/this weekend: Nathan to get blinking LED bit stream on a board, or work with Rahul to figure out how to make it happen
Rest of team sort of in holding pattern while this gets done. 
Xiang continuing work on text display research for screen.
HaoYang continue 3D modeling work with curved lines

Heart-shaped justification:
  Once LCD showing different colors, blink every second, use LCD to show red color for V-day/4th of july use images/ holiday-based image display, etc.
  Don't track date, back to original phase 3 with image library, place buttons/ports on edge. Use buttons to cycle images instead of color if we get there.
