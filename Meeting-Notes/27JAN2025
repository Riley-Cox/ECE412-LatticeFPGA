Meeting Notes â€“ 27JAN2025  

Focus for the Week:  
- Ensure steady progress continues as workload and pressure will increase in the coming weeks.  
- Everyone should have their environment set up by now. If anyone needs help, contact Riley.  

Technical Notes:  
- Yosys recommends Verilator, but it will be used only as a linter, not for simulation.  
- Still need to figure out how to generate a bitstream from Yosys.  

Hardware Action Items:  
- Start purchasing Upduino boards for those who need them.  
- Main goal this week is to program the Upduino boards and verify they work with the toolchain.  
- Riley will reach out to Nathan to arrange getting a board to another group member.  

Status Updates:  
- All members present confirmed their environments are set up and Yosys is installed.  
- Need to contact Rahul this week for help setting up the Radiant toolchain.  
- Xiang and Mohammad will meet soon to work on SPI implementation.
