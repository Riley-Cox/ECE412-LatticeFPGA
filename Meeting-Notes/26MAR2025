Meeting notes 26MAR2025

Mohammad:
  Still working on Yosys synthesis for SPI so input pin for reset doesn't need set high
  Yosys synthesis works, but needs an active high connection to behave corectly
  Ready for integration

Xiang:
  No updates, waiting on guidance for documentation from Roy/Rahul

Riley/Nathan:
  Issues with inferred clocks on net clk in top module
  Unsure if these are the root cause of why Radiant isn't successfully programming the board
  Will try defining the net instead of the port for clock period
  Once synthesis warning is clear, will try with same clock speed as in Yosys implementation

Haoyang:
  Unable to attend today, ill


Team focus shifting to Yosys if Radiant issues have no progress by Friday. Will update Rahul if this happens.
