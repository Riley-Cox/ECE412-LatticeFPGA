Meeting notes for 14APR2025

Riley:
  Same as Nathan

Nathan:
  Changing colors with button works in simulation of isolated module. Further troubleshooting needed; screen has non-deterministic startup with button implemented. 

Mohammad:
  Going to get started on testing text display more thoroughly; sizes, locations, animations, help with button integration as needed.
  Moving over to Radiant troubleshooting instead, until Nathan and Riley done with spi button. 

Xiang:
  Unsure what to do; work on getting portable power delivery system. Work with Haoyang with on PCB when he gets the enclosure done

Haoyang:
  Needs to design PCB to keep everything neat inside enclosure. Need to do at least one more test print for the enclosure but pretty sure it's ready to go. 


Radiant troubleshooting:
  PLL needs translated
  are we putting the program on the board?
  Do we need to add in a single-cycle reset so we know everything is at a known initial state (difference in Yosys v. Radiant initial block protocol)
