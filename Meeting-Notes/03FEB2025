Meeting Notes â€“ 03FEB2025  

Updates:  
- Provided an update on the differences between Upduino versions.  
- Icicle core runs on Upduino 2.1, but SPI flash memory did not work.  
  - Issue is persistent and causes the board to stay in reboot.  
- Icicle does not support Wishbone, and IBEX does not work with Yosys.  
- Next steps involve introducing parallel work:  
  - Begin implementing the RISC-V core.  
  - Start focusing on writing C code.  

- A custom SPI driver will need to be written.  
- Encountered issues with enums and typedefs in the open-source toolchain.  
- Need to review one-hot vs regular multiplexer finite state machine design.  
- Plan to write the SPI module first, then regroup for integration.  

SystemVerilog Reminders:  
- Stay close to Verilog where possible for compatibility.  
- Use "logic" instead of "reg" in SystemVerilog.  
- Avoid packing and unpacking data types, especially during synthesis.  

Additional Notes:  
- Still waiting on OpenCores account approval.  
- OpenCores appears largely inactive; located some IP cores on GitHub as alternatives.  

Action Items:  
- Nathan and Riley need to meet and continue work on the RISC-V core.
