Meeting Notes

Riley: Hasn't been able to start on SPI skeleton yet, digging through adafruit libraries. 
  This weekend work on button interfacing code with Nathan so button press triggers Hello World print

Xiang: Translated the setup commands from adafruit library to initialize the LCD screen.
  Need to use translation to setup our own C functions
  Will work on priority list later

Mohammad: SPI module ready for physical test
  Simulation complete
  Synthesization complete - emulation tests to come shortly
  After emulation tests, will hook to LCD screen to test screen response

Nathan: Radiant duplicate module issue
  Going to attempt to resolve with Rahul 22FEB2025

Need more inter/inner-team communication; Xiang and Mohammad isolated from each other, SPI isolated from CORE

Future looking;
Riley and Mohammad to integrate SPI module once testing complete, Nathan to help when button and PWM complete
Nathan to do PWM/button implementation
Xiang to research color control on screen, then maybe text if possible

Haoyang sick again
