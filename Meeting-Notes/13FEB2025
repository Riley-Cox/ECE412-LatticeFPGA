Meeting Notes with Rahul – 12FEB2025
 
- Updated Rahul on the documentation for WSL installation and the associated toolchain.  
  - Noted that alternative Linux distributions can be explored if needed.  

SOC Block Diagram: 
- Current version is acceptable due to detailed Icicle Core information.  
- Agreed to reorder the diagram to resemble a more traditional SoC layout.  
  - Detailed CPU internals are not necessary.  
  - Diagram should include GPIO pinouts.  
  - UART functionality should be clearly indicated.  
- Observed that the bus appears to be general-purpose, capable of transferring data between components.  
  - Understanding the bus operation is critical for progressing with SPI development.  

LCD:
- Current LCD screens are out of stock. Concern raised about additional complexity if switching to another model.  
- Rahul suggested:  
  - If switching screens, purchase 5–10 units of the new model.  
  - Research 1.44” and 2.0” screens, create a comparison table versus the current screen, and check for common drivers.  

Project Status:
- RISC-V implementation completed.  
- Toolchain installed and documented.  
- Preliminary SPI controller designed (pending simulation, testing, and implementation).  
- UART functionality confirmed.  

Action Items for Mohammad: 
- Run SPI simulation on Questasim using the Radiant toolchain.  
- Watch the Lattice Semiconductor three-part video series on the Radiant software tool flow (available on YouTube).  

  
AI:
  - After completing SPI, explore integrating AI.  
  - One potential path: Port Tinyvision.ai’s SenseAI implementation to the current toolchain and board.  

To-Do:  
- Continue SPI simulation and testing.  
- Refactor SoC block diagram: remove CPU detail, add GPIO, indicate UART, ensure clear bus function.  
- Research 1.44” and 2.0” LCDs:  
  - Create comparison table.  
  - Determine driver compatibility.  
- Prepare for potential AI integration following Initial Phase completion (Planned for end of march).
