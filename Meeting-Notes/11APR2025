Meeting notes April 11 2025

Mohammad:
  Made unified C program with test to ensure that we don't need <stdint.h> library
  
Riley:
  Worked on button integration
  PWM is done, needs tested
  Color button needs memory connections to write to the location SPI is reading from
Nathan:
  Same as Riley
  Met with Rahul to grab hardware in Tigard
  
Xiang:
  Edited C code to ensure <stdint.h> is not necessary
  Added C code for sending text to display on screen
    3 new functions; draw character(), draw text(), fill rectangle()
Haoyang:
  Printed prototype 3d enclosure
  More work on 3D model

overall lacking week, waiting on Nathan to finish button stuff.
