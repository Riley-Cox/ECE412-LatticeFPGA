Discussion Points:

    Roy expressed concern about a lack of clear prioritization — multiple tasks are ongoing without a defined main focus.

    Another concern raised was the microcontroller comparison discussion happening without an implementation plan to support it.

    Nathan clarified that the primary goal is the toolchain comparison.

    Current plans include excessive validation steps that do not directly contribute to advancing project goals.

    Rahul agreed with Roy, suggesting clearer priorities:

        Get everything running on FPGA using Yosys first.

        Then focus on comparing results with the Lattice toolchain.

    Roy recommended starting with the Lattice toolchain due to its superior debug tool availability.

    Nathan noted that Verilator is only used as a linter, but Roy pointed out this won’t be necessary when using the Lattice toolchain.

    General agreement to start with what is known to work before expanding scope.
    
    Clarifications:

    Rahul confirmed that no license is required for the UltraPlus tool.

    Some RISC-V cores only support certain layouts for iCE40; ideally, a plug-and-play solution is preferred.

    Roy mentioned that RISC-V is optional — open cores are a valid alternative if RISC-V compatibility is an issue.

    SystemVerilog is broad, but the design subset is smaller and manageable.

    Rahul is fine with SystemVerilog if it is PNR (Place-and-Route) friendly.

To-Do:

    Correct "PDS" — SystemVerilog should be written as one word.

    Compare Upduino 2.1 vs. 3.0 to identify key differences.

    Note that the ideal target cost for the final product is $60, assuming Lattice provides materials.
